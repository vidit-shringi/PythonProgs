#Here are some of the attributes of a NumPy series that you can use in your program:

#size: Returns the number of elements in the series.
#shape: Returns the dimensions of the series.
#ndim: Returns the number of dimensions of the series.
#dtype: Returns the data type of the elements in the series.
#itemsize: Returns the size of each element in the series in bytes.
#nbytes: Returns the total size of the series in bytes.
#flags: Returns the information about the memory layout of the series.
#data: Returns the buffer containing the actual elements of the series.
#strides: Returns the number of bytes to step in each dimension when traversing the series.
#Hereâ€™s an example code snippet that demonstrates how to create a NumPy series and use some of its attributes:
import pyfiglet as pf
print(pf.figlet_format("Python_Series_Attributes"))

import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy series
s = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Print the size of the series
print("Size:", s.size)

# Print the shape of the series
print("Shape:", s.shape)

# Print the number of dimensions of the series
print("Number of dimensions:", s.ndim)

# Print the data type of the elements in the series
print("Data type:", s.dtype)

# Print the size of each element in the series in bytes
print("Size of each element (in bytes):", s.itemsize)

# Print the total size of the series in bytes
print("Total size (in bytes):", s.nbytes)

# Print the information about the memory layout of the series
print("Memory layout information:", s.flags)

# Print the buffer containing the actual elements of the series
print("Buffer:", s.data)

# Print the number of bytes to step in each dimension when traversing the series
print("Strides:", s.strides)
